# Breathless in NST

Robert Fripp's Exposure is my favorite album of all time, and Breathless is my favorite piece on that album (albiet not my favorite song of all time nor my favorite Robert Fripp recorded performance).

I love the Tony Williams-esque drumming of Narada Michael Walden and the pre-Music Man P-bass growl of Tony Levin. Great rhythm section.

It took me what feels like forever to break down the 9/8 over 11+11+14/16 figure between Fripp and TL/NMW respectively. 

Thanks to Albert Yeh for iterating on this with me, and to Albert, Deepak, James, Jason, and Mr. Laws for performing it with me at Glen Cove Guitar Circle in August.

[Here is the arrangement I came up with](../../../music/pdf/Breathless.pdf).
