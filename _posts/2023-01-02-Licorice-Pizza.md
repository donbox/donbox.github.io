# Licorice Pizza and NST

I love Paul Thomas Anderson's work.

I love Jon Brion's work, including his work on PTA's movies.

That stated, Jonny Greenwood composed a really beautiful theme for Licorice Pizza.

I did a simple NST arrangement of it prior to the 2022 Glen Cove Guitar Circle. We never adequately rehearsed it - maybe at a future event.

[Here is the arrangement I came up with](../../../music/pdf/Licorice-Pizza-Simplest-Theme.pdf).
