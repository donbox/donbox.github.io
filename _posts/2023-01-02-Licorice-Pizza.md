# Licorice Pizza and NST

I love Paul Thomas Anderson's work.

I transcribed Here We Go from Punch Drunk Love years ago, but Licorice Pizza has a really beautiful theme that I thought would sound nice in a Guitar Circle setting.

I did a simple arrangement of it prior to the 2022 Glen Cove Guitar Circle. We never adequately rehearsed it let alone performed it - maybe at a future event.  

The G1 part is really meant to be played by six guitarists, each picking a note in the sequence.
