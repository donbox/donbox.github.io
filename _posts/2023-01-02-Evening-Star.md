# Evening Star and NST

Evening Star is my favorite piece of music from the Fripp/Eno collaborations of the 1970's.

I recently did a simple arrangement for NST of the looped material suitable for soloing over.

I've mostly worked out the primary melody that Robert plays that I hope to come back and add to the score. 

[Here is the arrangement I came up with](../../../music/pdf/Evening_Star.pdf).
