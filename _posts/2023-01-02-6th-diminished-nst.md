# 6th Diminished and NST

It's embarrasing to admit, but I just discovered the 6th diminished chord voicings.

I've known the scale forever (the opening phrase of Donna Lee is based on it), but the chord voicing was new to me.

The property of alternating Maj6 and dim7 chords spelling out the scale in four part harmony blew my mind!  It also is how jazz piano and guitar sound - wow. 

I spent a day or two on piano starting to get it into my head, and of course spent some time today putting it under my fingers on NST Guitar.

Here are [my first attempts](../../../music/pdf/6th-diminished.pdf) at NST voicings.
