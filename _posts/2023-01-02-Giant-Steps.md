# Giant Steps and NST

I started with Guitar Circle just prior to COVID, and we wound up doing a few months of Zoom-based courses every Saturday while we awaited a safe IRL experience. 

One of the assigments was to prepare a short piece to perform (over Zoom :-|).

I elected to play the changes to Giant Steps, which I knew would start to move my playing out of the standard NST/GC repertoire into the realm of "normal" music. 

[Here is the arrangement I came up with](../../../music/pdf/Giant-Steps.pdf).
