# I May Have Haaden Two Much...

During my nomadic summer of 2022, I picked up an inexpensive guitar to keep in NYC given that I am there enough and there are crafties to play with in/near the city.

I had time on one of my visits to transcribe two more pieces from Exposure. 

This time, [Haaden Two](../../../music/pdf/Haaden_Two.pdf) and 
[I May Not Have Enough Of Me But I've Had Enough Of You](../../../music/pdf/I_May_Not_Have_Enough_Of_Me But_I've_Had_Enough_Of_You.pdf).
