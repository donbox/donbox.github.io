I'm finding that I need a place to write longer form text that can have stable links. I doubt that I'll ever write another long-form book, but I am definitely finding myself in essay mode.  For a little while at least.

Lately I've been spending my programming time in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and spelunking the plethora of [IDL and RPC systems that have cropped this century](https://twitter.com/donbox/status/1402720653942218753). 

Musically, I'm finally getting serious about studying the guitar and learning to play (gasp) with a pick.
