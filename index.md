I'm finding that I need a place to write longer form text that can have stable links. I doubt that I'll ever write another long-form book, but I am definitely finding myself in essay mode. 

Lately I've been spending my programming time in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) and spelunking the plethora of [IDL and RPC systems that have cropped this century](https://twitter.com/donbox/status/1402720653942218753). 

Musically, I'm finally getting serious about studying the guitar and learning to play (gasp) with a pick.

I doubt that I'll write much long form text - it's way easier to post to the usual social media pipes:

- [Me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/donbox)
- [Me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/don-box-1a27b/)
- [Me on GitHub](https://github.com/donbox)
- [Me on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/don.box/)

Note that Instagram is pretty much read-only for me - I'm a horrible photographer.
